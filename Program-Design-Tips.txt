1. Program Design: Minimize Global Variables

Although there are times when globals are useful, variables assigned in
a def are local by default because that is normally the best policy.

2. Program Design: Minimize Cross-File Changes

The problem with the assignment to first.X, however, is that it is far too implicit: 
whoever’s charged with maintaining or reusing the first module probably has no 
clue that some arbitrarily far-removed module on the import chain can change X out 
from under him or her at runtime.


Multithreading runs function calls in parallel with the rest of the program

Because all threaded functions run in the same process, global scopes often serve as one form of shared
memory between them (threads may share both names in global scopes, as well as objects in a process’s
memory space).

Threading is commonly used for long-running tasks in GUIs, to implement nonblocking
operations in general and to maximize CPU capacity



That’s the main point about modules: by segregating variables on a per-file basis, 
they avoid name collisions across files, in much the same way that local 
variables avoid name clashes across functions.
